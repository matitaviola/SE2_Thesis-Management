The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
    - Estimated hours per task avarage: 96 / 35 ≈ 2.74 hours
    - Actual hours per task avarage: ??? / 35 ≈ ??? hours

    - Estimated standard deviation: ≈ ??? hours
    - Actual standard deviation: ≈ ??? hours

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
    - Total Task Estimation Error Ratio = (96 / ???) - 1 ≈ -0.2128

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 10
  - Total hours spent: ???
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: ???
  - Coverage (if available): 100%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2
  - Total hours spent: ???
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 2
  - Total hours spent: 1h 15m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Inexperience with task estimation:
    It was the first time we planned and estimated hours for tasks, which made it difficult to accurately predict the time needed for each task.

  - Team members availability:
    We initially planned the sprint for a team of 6 members, but only 5 team members were available to work on the tasks. We had to redistribute the workload among the available team members, potentially causing delays or impacting work on other tasks.

  - Learning new technologies
    We had to learn about new technologies, underestimating the time required and the impact on subsequent tasks.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Importance of collaboration within the team.
  - Ability to adapt to changes, rescheduling work for 5 team members.
  - Experience with time planning. We understood the difficulty in estimating times and improved our skill in this activity.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  It was the first sprint.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Propose one or two

  - Estimating hours more consciously
  - Do not underestimate the time to be spent and the effort to learn new technologies

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  We completed all the stories we had planned.
